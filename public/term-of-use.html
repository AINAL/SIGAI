        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="policy-intro">
          Welcome to Sigai! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Sigai mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <div class="policy-content">
          <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
          <p>
            Sigai is designed to help primary school students learn multiplication and division through visual and interactive tools. The App may include features such as guided drawing, language preferences, progress tracking, and AI-powered chat assistance.
          </p>
          <p>By using the App, you agree to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the App only for educational and non-commercial purposes.</li>
            <li>Provide accurate and lawful input when interacting with the app or AI chat features.</li>
            <li>Not use the App in any way that disrupts, damages, or interferes with its operation.</li>
            <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your region.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. AI-Powered Chat Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The AI assistant in Sigai is powered by Firebaseâ€™s AI APIs. It is intended to support basic learning and provide help with understanding math problems. While we strive for helpful and accurate responses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The AI may occasionally produce incorrect or incomplete information.</li>
            <li>You should not rely solely on the AI for academic or critical decisions.</li>
            <li>Sigai does not store or retain any conversation history.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Data and Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Sigai collects minimal data, such as app usage analytics and non-personal preferences (e.g., language settings, progress bar), which are stored locally using AppStorage. By using the App, you agree to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            All content within the App, including logos, designs, graphics, and instructional tools, are the property of Sigai and protected by copyright and trademark laws. You may not copy, distribute, reproduce, or use any content without written permission from the Sigai team.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Restrictions on Use</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the app or its code.</li>
            <li>You may not use the app to engage in illegal or unauthorized activities.</li>
            <li>You may not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or misuse the AI feature.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            Sigai integrates services such as Firebase (for AI chat and analytics). These services are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for data collected or used by these third parties.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we strive for accuracy and uptime, we do not guarantee uninterrupted service or error-free operation. Sigai is not liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use or inability to use the app.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Termination of Use</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the App at any time, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms or misuse the app.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Updates to the App and Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Sigai may be updated from time to time to add new features, fix bugs, or enhance performance. We may also update these Terms periodically. Continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the new Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Malaysia (or your local jurisdiction if specified by law). Any disputes will be resolved through appropriate legal channels.
          </p>
